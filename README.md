### Multiple-protein-protein-energies-interactions-with-Foldx
### Install Foldx from its web page (http://foldxsuite.crg.eu/)
### Be sure you have "foldx", "rotabase", and your PDB files in the same directory. 
### Foldx does not run using "for" (loop) command when it is on the path (so do not path the directory if you plan to analyse multiple proteins).
